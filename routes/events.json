The event recognizes their accomplishments, hard work, and dedication, while simultaneously acknowledging the accomplishments of our student&rsquo;s families and networks of support. Distinguished speakers, student awards, performances, and the incorporation of African culture and traditions&mdash;specifically the culminating Kente Stole presentation&mdash;all add to the vibrancy of this celebratory day.</p>\r\n<p>Participation in the Rites of Passage Ceremony is open to all Black and Latinx-identified Rutgers University &ndash; New Brunswick Undergraduate and Graduate students who have earned their degree between January 2022 and August 2022. In order to participate,&nbsp;<strong>students must register by April 22nd, 2022</strong>&nbsp;through the getINVOLVED portal. Only students who have registered by this date are guaranteed to be listed in the program and receive a kente stole. The late registration deadline is May 1st. All graduates are required to wear their academic regalia, which can be purchased from the Barnes and Noble Rutgers University Bookstore on Somerset Street.
