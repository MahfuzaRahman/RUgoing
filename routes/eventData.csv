  <div class=""p-name summary"">RUSEPRC Alexander Library Destressor</div>
  <div class=""p-description description""><div>After a long hiatus, we are finally back to doing our annual destressor event at the Alexander Library on College Ave! We will be outside the library on the patio for this event. In case of rain, the rain date will be on the 4th at the same time, 2pm. At this event we allow stressed college students to pet the puppies as they prepare to take their finals. This event is a great opportunity to educate the public about our club and the mission of The Seeing Eye. Puppies will get ample practice with greeting people politely and calmly, and members will also get to practice handling the puppies and ensuring they are on their best behavior.&nbsp;</div>
